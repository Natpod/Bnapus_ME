The following folder contains the code implemented to generate annotated lists filtered by categories of interest, across

- Leading edge GSEA results from categories of interest in 
1) HeatStress (_Conventional Microspore Embryogenesis_ : Ctrl-PE - VM) expression data
2) HeatStress - SAHA (_Microspore Embryogenesis with HDACi treatment_ : Ctrl-PE - VM) expression data
3) HeatStress (Conventional Microspore Embryogenesis : Ctrl-PE - VM) expression data
-  Filtered gene list in DEG subset intersections in Embryogenesis Differential expression condition lists
-  Filtered gene list in WGCNA behaviours A ( coexpressed in proembryos, not in Microspores) and B ( coexpressed in microspores, not in proembryos)

It also contains statistics about gene-categories in:
1) DEG subset intersections in Embryogenesis Differential expression condition lists (HeatStress / HeatStress + SAHA)
2) WGCNA behaviours A ( coexpressed in proembryos, not in Microspores) and B ( coexpressed in microspores, not in proembryos)
