This folder contains a series of Venn Diagram representations of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) intersections among the three lists described in the parent folder `DifferentialExpression`.

*`Intersection_DEG_Embryogenesis_notsegmented.png`: VM vs SAHA Treated PE and VM vs Ctrl PE DEG lists intersections
*`Intersection_DEG_Embryogenesis_segmented.png`:VM vs SAHA Treated PE and VM vs Ctrl PE DEG lists intersections, separated as well by type of expression (increased or decreased)
*`Intersection_DEG_all3subsets.png`: all three DEG lists

It also contains a series of tsv with annotations of each intersecting subset of DEGs of interest
